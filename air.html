                            Overview
                        </h2>

                        <p>Auto Insurance is USAA's fl screen was due for an overhaul. It was implemented in 2015 I helped redesign USAA's Auto Insurance Acquistion application in 2015. The effort was a multi-year journey Initially we aimed to bring the
                            web experience to iOS, but discovered student confusion to be a high priority in addition to parity. Part of this initiative meant rethinking how RaiseMe communicates important scholarship earning requirements for iOS.
                            <p>
                                On USAA’s Auto Acquisition Quote Results screen, users were having <strong>trouble
                            performing critical tasks</strong> such as viewing bundling options, editing insurance coverages, and <strong>understanding how to buy the policy</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We aimed to build a solution that would be easy to understand, provide valuable relevant content, and drive users to the next steps of the process. We wanted a visually appealing design that would be “future-proof” with the mindset of being able to test,
                                learn and adapt.
